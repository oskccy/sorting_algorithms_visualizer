## Introduction
Sorting Visualizer is a web application built with React that visualizes various sorting algorithms in real-time. It allows users to generate a new array, and select from a range of sorting algorithms to watch how they operate on the array.

## Features
Generates an array of random numbers between 5 and 650, and displays them as bars.
Animates the sorting algorithms in real-time, providing an intuitive understanding of their operation.
Allows users to choose from three sorting algorithms: Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, and Selection Sort.
## Technologies Used
- React
- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS
## Installation
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/oskccy/sorting_algorithms_visualizer
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd sorting-visualizer.
3. Install the required dependencies: npm install.
## Usage
1. Run the application: npm start.
2. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.
## Algorithms
#### *Merge Sort*
Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides an array into halves, sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves. It has a time complexity of: $O(nlog(n))$.

#### *Bubble Sort*
Bubble sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It has a time complexity of: $O(n^2)$.

#### *Selection Sort*
Selection sort repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted part. It has a time complexity of: $O(n^2)$.
